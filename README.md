Not a formal project, just a personal learning repository for Node.js. The frontend is built with React and Vite, while the backend uses Express and MongoDB. The project includes features like note creation, viewing, and a simple rate limiting mechanism. The frontend is styled with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS. The backend is set up with Express, CORS, and Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.

I made this a while back, you can try it out though (if it still works lol): https://open-reviews.vercel.app/

Have a great day! :>
