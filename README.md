# Sermon Notes

Not a formal project, just a personal learning repository for Node.js. The frontend is built with React and Vite, while the backend uses Express and MongoDB. The project includes features like note creation, viewing, and a simple rate limiting mechanism. The frontend is styled with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS. The backend is set up with Express, CORS, and Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.

I am using it to keep my sermon notes in-tact! Hope they inspire you and bring a good change! <3

Have a great day! :>
